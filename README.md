The files contained in this repo are clean starter files required to create mods for AoE2 DE, the following files are included;

1. empires2_x2_p1.dat.zip (required for a data mod)
2. info.json (required for a data mod)
3. key-value-modded-strings-utf8.txt (required for a text mod)

The zipped empires2_x2_p1.dat file should be considered as a pre Alpha state file that can be used but far from complete. That siad it's in a completely different league to the empires2_x2_p1.dat file that's included with AoE2 DE, we've corrected scores of errors.

Downloading and using any of our files are at your own risk, though it's not possible to damage the game with these file so long as they're used for their intended purpose, which is for creating mods.

More info and documentation can be obtained from the [AGE and AoE Wiki](https://idev.mx/index.php?title=Main_Page)
