The files contained in this repo are clean starter files required to create mods for AoE2 DE, the following files are included;

1. empires2_x2_p1.dat.zip (required for a data mod)
2. info.json (required for a data mod)
3. key-value-modded-strings-utf8.txt (required for a text mod)

The zipped empires2_x2_p1.dat file should be considered as a pre Alpha state file that can be used but far from complete.

More info and documentation can be obtained from the [AGE and AoE Wiki](https://idev.mx/index.php?title=Main_Page)
